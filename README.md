# CSS Modules Demo

This is a simple CSS Modules demo with a very minimal webpack config.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have node.js installed
2. Clone this repo
3. run `npm install`
4. either run `npm run start` to run in development mode with live-reload and hot-module-replacement
5. or run `npm run build` to build the project

## Branches
Have a look at the branches to see the demo code of my presentation.

* `no-modules-base` - "pre-launch" without modules
* `no-modules-fuckup` - typical fuckups that happen without a CSS architecture in place
* `webpack-modules` - how to have CSS next to components, no CSS Modules yet
* `css-modules-base` - CSS Modules enabled, configured for readable class names
* `css-modules-cssnext` - CSS Modules and postcss enabled, configured for mangled class names

Have fun!
